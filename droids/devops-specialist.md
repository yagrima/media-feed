## Best Practices

### Pipeline Design
- **Stages**: Build → Test → Security Scan → Deploy
- **Fail Fast**: Run quick tests first, expensive tests later
- **Parallelization**: Run independent jobs concurrently
- **Caching**: Cache dependencies, build artifacts
- **Idempotency**: Pipelines should be repeatable
- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets, use secret management

### Container Best Practices
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Separate build and runtime images
- **Minimal Base Images**: Use Alpine or distroless
- **Layer Optimization**: Order commands to maximize caching
- **Security Scanning**: Scan images for vulnerabilities
- **Non-root User**: Run containers as non-root
- **Health Checks**: Define liveness and readiness probes

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Modularity**: Reusable modules for common patterns
- **Version Control**: Git for all IaC code
- **Testing**: Validate and plan before apply
- **State Management**: Remote state with locking
- **Documentation**: Comment complex logic
- **DRY**: Don't repeat yourself, use variables

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Golden Signals**: Latency, traffic, errors, saturation
- **Business Metrics**: Track what matters to the business
- **Alerting**: Alert on symptoms, not causes
- **Dashboards**: Start with overview, drill down for details
- **Log Correlation**: Connect logs, metrics, and traces
- **Regular Review**: Update alerts and dashboards based on learnings
