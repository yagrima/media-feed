## 🛠️ Deployment Commands

### 1. Quick Deployment
```bash
# Using PowerShell
cd "C:\Dev\Me(dia) Feed\scripts"
.\deploy-production.ps1

# Alternatively using Docker Compose directly
docker-compose -f docker-checks.yml up -d --build
```

### 2. With Dry Run (Tests Only)
```bash
# Run tests only
.\deploy-production.ps1 -SkipTests
python tests/integration/test_production_readiness.py
```

### 3. Health Checks
```bash
# Check all services
docker-compose -f docker-checks.yml ps

# Check service health
docker-compose -f docker-checks.yml exec backend curl -f http://localhost:8000/health

# Check logs
docker-compose -f docker-checks.yml logs -f backend
docker-compose -f docker-checks.yml logs -f frontend
```

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### 🔄 Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Stop new deployment
docker-compose -f docker-checks.yml down

# Restore from backup
docker volume restore mefeed_postgres_data_backup
docker volume restore mefeed_redis_data_backup

# Start previous version
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### 📞 Critical Issues Response
1. **Database Issues**: Check connection, restore from backup
2. **Email Failures**: Verify SMTP credentials, check Brevo status
3. **Performance**: Check resource usage, scale if needed
4. **Security**: Review logs, check for breaches, rotate keys
5. **Outage**: Activate maintenance mode, diagnose, fix, restore
