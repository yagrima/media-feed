## User Story Evaluation (0-10 Scale)

### Navigation & User Experience

**As a user, I want to click on the "Me Feed" logo/text in the top left corner to return to the dashboard from any page, so that I always have a quick way to get back to my overview. [10/10]**

**As a user, I want the dashboard to be my central hub that shows me at-a-glance statistics about all my media consumption, so that I can quickly understand my viewing/reading habits without navigating through different sections. [10/10]**

---

### Dashboard & Overview

### Media Import & History Management

As a Netflix user, I want to upload my viewing history CSV so that I can import all my watched content into the system. [9/10]

As a user, I want to see the progress of my CSV import so that I know when it's completed and if there are any errors. [8/10]

As a user, I want to view my import history so that I can track when I last updated my media library. [7/10]

**As a user, I want the system to automatically detect which platform my CSV file is from based on its format/headers, so that I don't have to manually select the platform each time. [0/10]**

**As a user, I want to receive a reminder notification every X weeks (configurable) to update my viewing history, with direct links to each platform's download page, so that my data stays current without me having to remember. [0/10]**

As a admin, I want to provide a larger library of media files for users to search. [0/10]

---

### Browser Extension & Automated Sync (Future Features)

**As a user, I want to install a lightweight browser extension that can automatically export my viewing history from Netflix, so that I don't have to manually download CSV files repeatedly. [0/10]**

**As a user, I want the browser extension to run in the background and sync my viewing history on a schedule I configure (daily/weekly/monthly), so that my Me Feed library is always up-to-date without manual intervention. [0/10]**

**As a user, I want the browser extension to require my explicit consent before accessing any data and clearly show me what data will be sent to Me Feed, so that I maintain full control over my privacy. [0/10]**

### API-Based Integration (Conditional on Platform APIs)

**As a platform developer, I want the Me Feed backend to support OAuth2 integration for streaming platforms that offer APIs, so that users can authorize automatic data access without manual CSV uploads. [0/10]**

**As a user, I want to connect my streaming accounts via OAuth (if the platform supports it) and have Me Feed automatically fetch new viewing activity in the background, so that I never have to think about imports again. [0/10]**

**As a system administrator, I want the backend to gracefully handle platform API rate limits and unavailability, with automatic retry logic and user notifications, so that temporary issues don't break the service. [0/10]**

### Media Discovery & Library Management

As a user, I want to browse my entire media library with filters so that I can easily find specific movies or TV shows. [7/10]

**As a user viewing TV series in my library, I want to see exactly ONE card per series (not one per episode) with the accurate number of episodes I've watched (e.g., "Arcane (18/XX)") so that my library remains organized and I can track my viewing progress at a glance. [10/10]**

**As a user who watches the same series in different languages (e.g., Season 1 in English, Season 2 in German), I want the system to recognize them as the SAME series and show me ONE card with the TOTAL episode count across all languages, so that my viewing history is consolidated correctly. [10/10]**

**As a user viewing movies in my library, I want episode counts to be completely hidden because they don't make sense for films and would only add visual clutter. [10/10]**

**As a backend developer, I want the system to store ONE Media entry per series and multiple UserMedia entries per episode (with season_number, episode_number, episode_title) so that the library can display one card per series while tracking individual episodes. [10/10]**

**As a user viewing episode details, I want to see all episodes organized by season with collapsible/expandable season groups, so that I can navigate through the series structure efficiently without being overwhelmed by too much information at once. [10/10]**

**As a user, I want seasons I have watched (fully or partially) to be automatically expanded by default, along with the next unwatched season, while the rest remain collapsed, so that I can immediately see my current progress and what comes next without manual interaction. [10/10]**

**As a user viewing episodes within a season, I want each episode to show its number and title when collapsed, and additionally show episode description when expanded, so that I can quickly scan episode names or dive deeper into content details as needed. [10/10]**

**As a user, I want smooth animations when expanding/collapsing seasons and episodes, and the ability to close the modal with ESC key or clicking outside, so that the interface feels polished and intuitive. [10/10]**
