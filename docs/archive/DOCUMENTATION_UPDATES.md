## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why frontend-first instead of completing backend?**
A: Backend is functionally complete (auth + CSV import working). Frontend is the blocker to user testing.

**Q: Isn't Celery critical for CSV processing?**
A: For <100 users and <10K row CSVs, synchronous processing is acceptable (2-3 min max). Celery needed at scale.

**Q: What if the frontend takes longer than 5 days?**
A: We have buffer - can extend to 7 days. Using shadcn/ui and Next.js 14 with clear specs should keep on track.

**Q: Are we compromising security by rushing?**
A: No. All security features (auth, validation, rate limiting) are complete. Security hardening (logging, monitoring) deferred but not skipped.

**Q: What if users don't like the product?**
A: That's the point! We learn at Week 3 instead of Week 6. Can pivot based on feedback.

## Conclusion

The documentation has been updated to reflect a **Frontend-First MVP strategy** that delivers user-facing value 50% faster without cutting any planned features.

**All work completed (Weeks 1-3A) is preserved and utilized.**
**All planned features (Celery, multi-platform, etc.) remain in scope, just resequenced.**

The new roadmap provides:
- âœ… Clear week-by-week guidance
- âœ… Detailed implementation specs
- âœ… Success criteria per phase
- âœ… Risk mitigation strategies
- âœ… Resource requirements

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Week 3B (Frontend MVP) immediately.
