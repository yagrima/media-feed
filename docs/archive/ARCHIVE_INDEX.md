## Why These Were Archived

**Historical Progress Reports**: These documents served their purpose during active development but are now superseded by the comprehensive PROJECT_STATUS.md which provides current status.

**Security Implementation Reports**: Multiple incremental reports have been consolidated into SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md and PROJECT_STATUS.md. The granular progress tracking is no longer needed.

**Roadmap Documents**: MVP_ROADMAP.md and FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION.md have been consolidated into PROJECT_STATUS.md for single source of truth.

**Documentation Updates**: These were meta-documents tracking documentation changes. Not needed for ongoing development.

## Accessing Archived Documents

All archived documents are available in `docs/archive/` directory for historical reference. They contain valuable context about:
- Security implementation decisions
- Week-by-week progress tracking
- Original roadmap and planning
- Incremental security improvements

**Use Case**: Refer to archives when you need context on why specific decisions were made or detailed historical progress.

## Documentation Maintenance

**Active documents should be updated** when:
- Project status changes (weekly or at phase completion)
- Architecture decisions are made
- Security findings require updates
- Test coverage changes significantly
- Roadmap adjustments occur

**Archive documents when**:
- They become superseded by consolidated documents
- They represent completed historical milestones
- They are no longer referenced in active development
