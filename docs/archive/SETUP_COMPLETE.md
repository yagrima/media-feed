# Me Feed - Setup Complete! ✓

**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Status**: Phase 1 Foundation Ready
**Next Step**: Start Development Server

---

## What's Been Done

### ✓ Security Keys Generated
All cryptographic keys have been created in the `secrets/` directory:
- `jwt_private.pem` - RSA private key for JWT signing
- `jwt_public.pem` - RSA public key for JWT verification
- `encryption.key` - Fernet encryption key for sensitive data
- `secret_key.txt` - Session secret key
- `db_password.txt` - PostgreSQL password
- `redis_password.txt` - Redis password

### ✓ Environment Configured
Your `.env` file has been created with the generated SECRET_KEY.

### ✓ Project Structure Ready

## Next Steps

### 1. Start Docker Services

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL and Redis
docker-compose up -d db redis

# Verify services are running
docker-compose ps
```

Expected output:
```
NAME              STATUS    PORTS
mefeed_db         running   5432/tcp
mefeed_redis      running   6379/tcp
```

### 2. Setup Python Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# Windows PowerShell:
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Windows CMD:
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- FastAPI & Uvicorn
- SQLAlchemy & Asyncpg (database)
- JWT libraries (python-jose, PyJWT)
- Security libraries (passlib, cryptography)
- Redis client
- And more...

### 4. Initialize Database

```bash
# Make sure you're in the backend directory
cd backend

# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head
```

Expected output:
```
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade  -> xxx, Initial migration
```

### 5. Start the Backend Server

```bash
# From backend directory
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Expected output:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
INFO:     Started reloader process
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
Starting Me Feed v1.1.0
Debug mode: False
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### 6. Test the API

Open your browser to: **http://localhost:8000/docs**

You should see the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI).

---

## Quick API Test

### Test 1: Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "Me Feed",
  "version": "1.1.0"
}
```

### Test 2: Register a User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "demo@example.com",
    "password": "DemoPass123!"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "email": "demo@example.com",
  "email_verified": true,
  "created_at": "2025-10-18T...",
  "last_login_at": null
}
```

### Test 3: Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "demo@example.com",
    "password": "DemoPass123!"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 900
}
```

### Test 4: Access Protected Endpoint
```bash
# Replace YOUR_TOKEN with the access_token from login
curl http://localhost:8000/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "email": "demo@example.com",
  "email_verified": true,
  "created_at": "...",
  "last_login_at": "..."
}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "FileNotFoundError: JWT private key not found"
**Solution**: Make sure you ran `python scripts/generate_keys_simple.py` and the keys are in `secrets/` directory.

### Issue: Database connection refused
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL container is running
docker-compose ps

# If not running, start it
docker-compose up -d db

# Wait 10 seconds for it to be ready
```

### Issue: Redis connection refused
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if Redis container is running
docker-compose ps

# Start if needed
docker-compose up -d redis
```

### Issue: "SECRET_KEY must be at least 32 characters"
**Solution**: Your `.env` file should have the SECRET_KEY from `generate_keys_simple.py`. Check that it's properly set.

### Issue: Rate limit errors during testing
**Solution**:
```bash
# Restart Redis to clear rate limits
docker-compose restart redis
```

## What's Working

✅ **Authentication System**
- User registration with password validation
- User login with JWT tokens
- Token refresh mechanism
- Session management
- Account lockout after failed attempts

✅ **Security Features**
- RS256 JWT signing
- Argon2 password hashing
- Rate limiting (per-user and per-IP)
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging

✅ **API Endpoints**
- POST `/api/auth/register`
- POST `/api/auth/login`
- POST `/api/auth/refresh`
- POST `/api/auth/logout`
- GET `/api/auth/me`
- GET `/api/auth/sessions`
- DELETE `/api/auth/sessions/{id}`

- [ ] User preferences

### Weeks 5-6: Frontend
- [ ] Next.js application
- [ ] Authentication UI
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] Media library interface

---

## Development Tips

### Hot Reload
The backend runs with `--reload` flag, so any code changes will automatically restart the server.

### Database Management
```bash
# Create new migration after model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

# Apply migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback one migration
alembic downgrade -1
```

### Viewing Logs
```bash
# Docker service logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f db

# Application logs
# (Currently using print statements, will add structured logging)
```

### Stopping Services
```bash
# Stop all Docker services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (CAUTION: deletes database!)
docker-compose down -v
```
