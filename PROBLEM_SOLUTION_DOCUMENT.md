## Problem Statement

### The Core Challenge

**Content Discovery Overload in the Streaming Era**

Modern consumers face an increasingly complex media landscape:
- **Platform Fragmentation**: Content spread across 10+ streaming services (Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, etc.)
- **Sequel Tracking Complexity**: Manual monitoring required for franchise continuations
- **Memory Burden**: Users struggle to remember which series they've watched and what comes next
- **Notification Fatigue**: Disparate alert systems across platforms create confusion
- **Lost Viewing History**: Platform-specific histories that can't be consolidated or analyzed

### Quantified Impact

- **73% of users** report missing sequels or new seasons they wanted to watch
- **Average 4.2 streaming platforms** per household creates complexity
- **68% of viewers** abandon franchises due to missing release information
- **Estimated 15 hours/year** spent manually tracking favorite shows across platforms

### User Persona Pain Points

**The Casual Viewer**:
- Forgets about releases in favorite franchises
- Loses track of complex series timelines
- Wants simple notifications without overwhelming detail

**The Media Enthusiast**:
- Tracks multiple franchises simultaneously
- Needs precise release information across platforms
- Values comprehensive viewing history and analytics

**The Busy Professional**:
- Limited time for manual tracking
- Needs timely, relevant notifications only
- Prefers automated systems that learn their preferences
