- Rationale: Simplicity for MVP
- Migration: Celery in Week 6

**4. HMAC Unsubscribe Tokens**
- ‚úÖ Good trade-off: Scalable, stateless
- Trade-off: Cannot revoke individual tokens
- Status: Acceptable for use case

**5. In-Memory SQLite for Tests**
- ‚úÖ Appropriate: Fast, isolated
- Trade-off: Minor DB behavior differences
- Status: Sufficient for MVP
